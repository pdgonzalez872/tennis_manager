#### Pete!

I hope you had a great time with Jessica yesterday, she seems really nice. You deserve it!

Here is the repo.

The idea is to do bookeeping for a tournament. Here is an example of a [draw](public/buenos_aires_draw.pdf).

I say the first thing we want to accomplish is to be able to render a draw. We will manually fill out the draw, for now.

Then, render time of match, location.

and that's pretty much it.

What do you think?

Please let me know, Paulo
